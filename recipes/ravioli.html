        <p>Coated with seasoned panko, these air-fried ravioli don't skimp on the crunch factor! Serve with your favorite dipping sauce such as warmed marinara, Alfredo, or ranch. Just be sure to thaw ravioli the night before!</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3 large eggs</li>
            <li>1/2 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 cup panko bread crumbs</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon garlic salt</li>
            <li>1 1/2 pounds frozen cheese ravioli, thawed</li>
            <li>1 serving cooking spray</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat an air fryer to 370 degrees F (188 degrees C) for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Whip eggs in a shallow bowl until lemon-colored and frothy. Combine flour, salt, and pepper in a separate dish. Mix panko, Italian seasoning, and garlic salt together in a third bowl.</li>
            <li>Dip thawed ravioli in eggs and dredge in flour. Dip ravioli back into eggs and finally turn in panko mixture. Shake off excess breading. Place coated ravioli into the air fryer basket. Lightly spray ravioli with nonstick spray.</li>
            <li>Cook in the preheated air fryer for 8 minutes. Turn ravioli and increase temperature to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Fry for an additional 2 minutes.</li>
